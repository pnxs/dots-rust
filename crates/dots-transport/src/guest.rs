//! Guest-side transceiver — the broker-facing equivalent of C++
//! `dots::GuestTransceiver`.
//!
//! A [`GuestTransceiver`] owns the shared subscription / dispatch /
//! pending-descriptor state for a guest. A [`GuestDriver<S>`] owns the
//! [`Connection<S>`] and pumps the read/write event loop. The pair is
//! created together by [`GuestTransceiver::from_connection`].
//!
//! This split lets non-TCP carriers (in-memory `tokio::io::duplex`,
//! Unix domain sockets, etc.) reuse the same publish/subscribe surface
//! as the high-level [`crate::App`] — and lets host-side tests run a
//! guest in the same process without networking.
